### **Goal**
- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the windowâ€™s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.
